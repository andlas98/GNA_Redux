# GNA (Gaming News Aggregator) REDUX
Created a website designed to display recent news from popular gaming sites! Check out its most current deployed status [here](https://andlas98.github.io/GNA_Redux/)!

## Purpose and Inspiration
... Every other day I peruse through several gaming websites such as Destructoid, Siliconera, and Polygon. Kinda miffed with how many sites I had to open at once, I wondered to myself, "Why not just roll all these sites that you love into one?" And the dream was born...

My inspiration for this site also came from a college friend of mine who is creating a similar aggregator for 100 Days of Code using a subbredit called r/hiphopheads for content. Shoutouts to you, Aaron!

**Basic Functions**
* Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery
* Provide links to various articles related to gaming (a la HackerNews), but personally curated (thus, not a forum)
* Grab articles from multiple popular VG sites (Destructoid, Rock Paper Shotgun, Game Informer) and lesser knowns (Siliconera, Eurogamer)
* Should load content from the past week (to keep things minimalistic)
* Filter for different types of articles (reviews, interviews, miscellaneous, reveals/announcements/debuts)
